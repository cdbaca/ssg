    <h1>Chapter 2: Training Principles and Tips</h1>

<h2>Notes &amp; Quotes</h2>

<p>While the previous chapter was general "laws" of running and training, Daniels gets a little closer to defining the rules of training, and a little more specific about the "whys" in this chapter.</p>

<p>Before giving specific tips/principles, he notes that extreme approaches to training should generally be avoided. Better to have a general training approach that's flexible for most/all runners than it is to train for the extremely talented, which may only lead to one or two runners performing well, leaving the rest behind.</p>

<h3>Principles of Training</h3>

<ul>
<li>The body reacts to stress</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>"Every time you impose a specific stress, there will be immediate reactions in different parts of your body.... over time there is a different reaciong to a particular repeated stress, and that is the body strengthening itself." (17)</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
<li>Specificity</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>"The tissues being stressed are the ones that react to that stress" (18) (i.e., train for what you're racing)</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
<li>Overstress</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>"If you overstress some body parts, they may not get tougher; in fact, they may get weaker or break down completely." (18)</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>"Whenever you are not sure which of two training sessions to take on at any particular time, select the less stressful of the two." (18)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You should always be able to answer the question, "What is the purpose of this workout?" &lt;-- this is a common, repeated maxim by Daniels.</p>

<ul>
<li>Training response</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>The body responds to "new stress." Usually with a fitness increase. Fitness then plateaus, which requires new, increased stress. There are several ways to increase stress:</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <ul>
  <li>Increase workload (run farther)</li>
  <li>Increase intensity (run faster)</li>
  <li>Decrease recovery (rest less between "intervals")</li>
  <li>Increase frequency (run more)</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>"It is not a good idea to change more than one of the training variables." (22)</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
<li>Personal limits</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>Everyone has limits, whether that's personal maximum limits or seasonal limits due to other responsibilities / commitments.</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
<li>Diminishing returns</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>Basically, it's harder to increase fitness the more fitness increases. (A 30 second mile-time decrease is much easier from 8:00 to 7:30 than it is from 5:30 to 5:00)</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
<li>Accelerating setbacks</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>There is essentially an "ideal window" for overall training intensity. As training intensity increases, the possibility and chance of setback increases drastically.</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
<li>Maintenance</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>"It is easier to maintain a level of fitness than it was to achieve that fitness" (26)</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>Other specific principles</h3>

<ul>
<li>Stride rate</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>In general, 180 steps / minute is the average ideal for runners, especially for racing. Running at 180 steps / minutes should also help normalize a runner's form without doing much else (e.g., they will find their natural most comfortable foot strike &amp; breath rate when trying to run at 180).</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
<li>Foot strike</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>Basically, it varies by athlete.</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
<li>Breathing while running</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>2-2 (breathe in for 2 steps, then out for 2 steps) is most common and probably most efficient for receiving oxygen at higher intensity levels. You can use this as a baseline to determine how hard an athlete is working</p>
</blockquote>
