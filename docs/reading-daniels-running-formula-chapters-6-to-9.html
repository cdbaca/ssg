    <h2>Notes &amp; Quotes</h2>

<p>The remainder of Part I of the book was relatively "common sense information" -- or information that I am personally not particularly interested in. These chapters covered environment/altitude specific training, treadmill training, "fitness training" (i.e., non-competitive training), and training breaks/supplemental training.</p>

<p>The altitude stuff I don't care much about at all. I will likely never be able to bring a team or runners up to Colarado to train (as much as I'd like to), and Daniels seems to indicate that it's not that big of a deal anyway. Moreso, the goal during training should be to mimic predicted race conditions.</p>

<p>I basically skipped the chapter on treadmill training. Again, not much I can do here with my own athletes, and if I'm stuck inside I'm not doing much on the treadmill because it sucks so much.</p>

<p>The fitness training chapter was decent, and will likely help me with some of my on-the-side coaching for brand new runners trying to get fit for local races or personal goals.</p>

<p>The training breaks/supplemental training chapter, again, was relatively common sense information. Although I do think his data on supplemental training for strength was lacking / out of date. I think it's relatively common knowledge in the running world now that strength training for runners should include heavy lifting. Body weight stuff, while it might help a little, will not provide the injury prevention/strength benefits needed to sustain a ton of mileage.</p>

<p>A big note from Daniels on resting is that athletes and coached ought to be very open to resting, both for planned and unplanned periods of time. Unplanned for things like illness/injury and planned for resisting burnout.</p>
