            <content:encoded><![CDATA[ <h1>Chapter 3: Physiological and Personal Training Profiles</h1>

<h2>Notes</h2>

<p>The big takeaway from this chapter seems to be that there are a variety of baseline metrics that can be used to measure performance potential:</p>

<ul>
<li>VO2 Max (maximum oxygen consumption rate) </li>
<li>vVO2 Max (speed at which the athlete runs when at VO2 Max)</li>
<li>Running economy (the curve on which we determine a runner's oxygen consumption at various intensity levels)</li>
<li>BLa (Blood lactate levels at various intensity levels)</li>
<li>Heart rate (max HR, resting HR, blood hemoglobin levels)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Quotes</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>"It is without question that vVO2 max is a better way to compare potential running performance than is either economoy or VO2 independently." (38)</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>"The important thing for any runner is to improve as many variables as possible in order to perform better... it is necessary to include training that will ipmrove aerobic power (VO2 max) and running economy, and as either, or both, of these variables ipmroves, there will be an improvement in the important vVO2 max variable." (42)</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>"If the purpose of a specific workout is to spend time at a specific <em>speed</em> of running, then it might be necessary to not let heart rate be the guide. but if <em>intensity</em> of effort is the most important thing being sought, then heart rate can be very useful."</p>

            <title>Algorithms Aren't Smart</title>
            <pubDate>2025-05-17 11:22:19</pubDate>
            <link>https://cdbaca.github.io/ssg/algorithms-aren-t-smart.html</link>
            <guid>https://cdbaca.github.io/ssg/algorithms-aren-t-smart.html</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[ <p>When I was in college (and for some time after when I had my first office job), I helped tutor a class called developmental math for several years. Tom Ferguson was the professor of that class when I first started, and the guy was incredibly smart -- sometimes to the detriment of those poor students trying to get by in the bare bones of college-level mathematics.</p>

<p>Once, when explaining to students about how to reason about some math problem and when calculators were useful and when they weren't, he said simply, "Calculators are stupid. They don't know anything."</p>

<p>This was long before my journey into trying to understand the very basics of programming and computer science, so I didn't really know what he meant at the time. Of course, I do now. Calculators, computers -- anything digital really -- are stupid. They don't / can't know anything, and if you give them even the <em>slightest</em> wrong instruction, they will follow it with no regard for what you meant. (LLMs notwithstanding, though I think the argument can be made they're just stupid in a different way?)</p>

<p>This memory came back to me when reading this blog post (<a href="https://tadaima.bearblog.dev/if-nothing-is-curated-how-do-we-find-things/">"If nothing is curated, how do we find things?"</a>). Quote:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>"And algorithms can only predict content that you've seen before. It'll never surprise you with something different. It keeps you in a little bubble. Oh, you like shoegaze? Well, that's all the algorithm is going to give you until you intentionally start listening to something else."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is my experience exactly. The algorithms are stupid too. They only repeat, relentlessly. There's no magic in it, no surprise. Most often, it feels the the new, best experiences I've had with media or food or other kinds of consumption happened because I stumbled upon it by accident, through a friend recommendation (and no, not through a "social network"), or through making a connection to a work that I liked (Ã  la Austin Kleon's note about "reading what your favorite authors read").</p>

<p>Algorithms aren't smart, but people sometimes are.</p>

            <title>Reading Daniels' Running Formula - Chapter 2</title>
            <pubDate>2025-05-16 10:38:48</pubDate>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[ <h1>Chapter 2: Training Principles and Tips</h1>

<h2>Notes &amp; Quotes</h2>

<p>While the previous chapter was general "laws" of running and training, Daniels gets a little closer to defining the rules of training, and a little more specific about the "whys" in this chapter.</p>

<p>Before giving specific tips/principles, he notes that extreme approaches to training should generally be avoided. Better to have a general training approach that's flexible for most/all runners than it is to train for the extremely talented, which may only lead to one or two runners performing well, leaving the rest behind.</p>

<h3>Principles of Training</h3>

<ul>
<li>The body reacts to stress</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>"Every time you impose a specific stress, there will be immediate reactions in different parts of your body.... over time there is a different reaciong to a particular repeated stress, and that is the body strengthening itself." (17)</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
<li>Specificity</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>"The tissues being stressed are the ones that react to that stress" (18) (i.e., train for what you're racing)</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
<li>Overstress</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>"If you overstress some body parts, they may not get tougher; in fact, they may get weaker or break down completely." (18)</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>"Whenever you are not sure which of two training sessions to take on at any particular time, select the less stressful of the two." (18)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You should always be able to answer the question, "What is the purpose of this workout?" &lt;-- this is a common, repeated maxim by Daniels.</p>

<ul>
<li>Training response</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>The body responds to "new stress." Usually with a fitness increase. Fitness then plateaus, which requires new, increased stress. There are several ways to increase stress:</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <ul>
  <li>Increase workload (run farther)</li>
  <li>Increase intensity (run faster)</li>
  <li>Decrease recovery (rest less between "intervals")</li>
  <li>Increase frequency (run more)</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>"It is not a good idea to change more than one of the training variables." (22)</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
<li>Personal limits</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>Everyone has limits, whether that's personal maximum limits or seasonal limits due to other responsibilities / commitments.</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
<li>Diminishing returns</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>Basically, it's harder to increase fitness the more fitness increases. (A 30 second mile-time decrease is much easier from 8:00 to 7:30 than it is from 5:30 to 5:00)</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
<li>Accelerating setbacks</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>There is essentially an "ideal window" for overall training intensity. As training intensity increases, the possibility and chance of setback increases drastically.</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
<li>Maintenance</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>"It is easier to maintain a level of fitness than it was to achieve that fitness" (26)</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>Other specific principles</h3>

<ul>
<li>Stride rate</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>In general, 180 steps / minute is the average ideal for runners, especially for racing. Running at 180 steps / minutes should also help normalize a runner's form without doing much else (e.g., they will find their natural most comfortable foot strike &amp; breath rate when trying to run at 180).</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
<li>Foot strike</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>Basically, it varies by athlete.</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
<li>Breathing while running</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>2-2 (breathe in for 2 steps, then out for 2 steps) is most common and probably most efficient for receiving oxygen at higher intensity levels. You can use this as a baseline to determine how hard an athlete is working</p>
</blockquote>

            <title>Various Discussions and Posts on LLMs</title>
            <pubDate>2025-05-16 09:44:40</pubDate>
            <link>https://cdbaca.github.io/ssg/various-discussions-and-posts-on-llms.html</link>
            <guid>https://cdbaca.github.io/ssg/various-discussions-and-posts-on-llms.html</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[ <p>Whether it is a flash in the pan or whether we're truly living in a time of great technological acceleration due to the advancement of LLMs, I do not know. What I do know is there are concerns and predictions across the board about the disruption LLMs are bringing -- to the economy, to education, to our very sense of what it means to be human.</p>

<p>This week I just happened to listen to and read quite a lot about "AI", that catch-all term we're currently using for the large language models built by Anthropic, OpenAI, Google, and so on (Another big 3! Go figure.).</p>

<p>A few links to what I came across this week:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/13/opinion/ezra-klein-podcast-rebecca-winthrop.html">Ezra Klein (maybe my favorite podcast interview show) interviewed Rebecca Winthrop</a>, the director of the Center for Universal Education at the Brookings Institution. I don't know anything about her, or didn't before this interview. What I found important in this conversation was the grappling with education and its purpose. Of course, even prior to the rise of LLMs as a "cheating tool," the value of education -- especially higher education -- was in question across the U.S. </p>

<p>And rightfully so! In my opinion, anyway. We got the purpose of higher ed all mixed up with the economy and the job market. When that happened, most people started needing some form of higher ed credential to even "be successful" (a term I'll leave there for now, knowing it is fraught). So then college becomes the game we play to make money and live our life as adults. That was already a problem prior to the rise of LLMs. And now, we have this magic tool that will largely do the work for us. If the purpose is the credential, and the credential is for material success, then OF COURSE. Of course our students will cheat. It makes no sense not to cheat.</p>

<p>But this conversation brings to light the real, foundational questions, which are:</p>

<ul>
<li>What is education?</li>
<li>What is education for?</li>
<li>How should education take place?</li>
</ul>

<p>(For those of you following for a long time, you'll know these are my baseline questions for understanding <em>anything</em>: What is it? What is it for?)</p>

<p>And of course, to really answer those questions, we need to ask even MORE fundamental questions -- what does it mean to be human? what does it mean to live a good life? Yet again, we were already encountering this problem in society, having lost the moorings of common ethical and religious foundations. I'm off on a tangent now, but LLMs, in this way, are apocalyptic in the literal sense. They reveal the truth of the matter, which is that we largely lack a cohesive narrative for orienting our lives.</p>

<p>The episode doesn't quite get into those last questions, but it is a thought-provoking conversation, especially as we are very involved in our kids' education and have thoughts about what it should do for them.</p>

<p>This morning I also listened to R<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNJJ9QUabkA">oss Douthat interview Daniel Kokotajlo</a>, former OpenAI employee and current executive director of the AI Futures Project. Kokotajlo believes that by 2027, AGI will not only exist but will also fundamentally remake the economy and the world as we know it. There will largely be no jobs because AI superintelligence will far outstrip humans' ability in basically all areas. This will be followed by a time of superabundance and will obviously be highly disruptive worldwide. While this was an interesting conversation, and I do not doubt that LLMs and whatever other versions of AI will continue to rapidly expand in its capabilities, I ultimately find these predictions unconvincing. Human systems are slow. Governments are slow. Corporations are slow. <em>Even if</em> the technology expands the way the interviewee says they will, I think there are pretty hard limits on how these tools are utilized. My primary thought for this entire interview was "Maybe he should have just become a sci-fi writer." His imagination is certainly capable of producing fascinating (if outlandish) scenarios.</p>

<p>H/T Alan Jacobs for <a href="https://nealstephenson.substack.com/p/remarks-on-ai-from-nz">this quote from Neal Stephenson</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Speaking of the effects of technology on individuals and society as a whole, Marshall McLuhan wrote that every augmentation is also an amputation...  Today, quite suddenly, billions of people have access to AI systems that provide augmentations, and inflict amputations, far more substantial than anything McLuhan could have imagined. This is the main thing I worry about currently as far as AI is concerned. I follow conversations among professional educators who all report the same phenomenon, which is that their students use ChatGPT for everything, and in consequence learn nothing.</p>
</blockquote>

<hr />

<p>Ultimately, my thoughts on LLMs are varied. They are technical miracles, and can produce "better than the best available human" in so many cases. I've used it multiple times for code questions, for gardening questions, and asked about illnesses. It is only getting "better." So perhaps the question we ought to ask ourselves is, what is it that this tool can never do that humans can? What do humans possess that this tool does not?</p>

            <title>Reading Daniels' Running Formula - Chapter 1</title>
            <pubDate>2025-05-15 15:40:20</pubDate>
            <link>https://cdbaca.github.io/ssg/reading-daniels-running-formula-chapter-1.html</link>
            <guid>https://cdbaca.github.io/ssg/reading-daniels-running-formula-chapter-1.html</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[ <p>In prepping for a new upcoming cross country season (with what will hopefully also be a good ramp up with summer training sessions for the team), I'm reading Daniels' Running Formula, and also would like to restart <em>Lore of Running</em> by Tim Noakes. <em>Lore</em> is a much larger and more technical book. In the meantime though, I feel like the best way to absorb this information is not only to read and mark up the book but also jot down notes from the chapter in summary to help it stick in my brain and refer back to when I need some guidance during the season.</p>

<h2>Notes &amp; Quotes</h2>

<h3>The Basic Ingredients</h3>

<p>There are four basic ingredients of success for runners: inherent ability, intrinsic motivation, opportunity, and direction.</p>

<p>Inherent ability is a "no-brainer" kind of factor. One that is likely the most important and cannot be changed. But when paired with motivation, opportunity, and direction, lower inherent ability can be trumped.</p>

<p>For runners who have a lot of inherent ability but low intrinsic motivation, one way to increase motivation is "asking... runners to feel the workouts and to feel the same workout getting easier before increasing training stress." (7)</p>

<p>For the opposite runner -- lower ability, higher motivation -- it can be important to emphasize that success and growth can happen in different time frames for different runners for a variety of reasons. Therefore "Every runniner should have short-term and long-term goals to shoot for." (7)</p>

<p>Opportunity, fortunately, is there for nearly all people. Running is neither expensive nor does it require specific weather or situations.</p>

<p>Direction largely has to do with coaching:</p>

<ul>
<li>"A good coach can always answer the questions 'What is the purpose of this workout?' and 'Why are we doing this workout today?'" (11)</li>
<li>"What coaches tend to overlook is the importance of giving positive individual attention to each athlete on the team. Nthing can replace encouraging comments or understanding words from a coach." (11)</li>
</ul>

<h3>Daniels' Basic Laws of Running:</h3>

<ul>
<li>Every runner has specific individual abilities. </li>
</ul>

<p>Key quote: "the main emphasis should be taking advantage of known strengths" (12)</p>

<ul>
<li>A runner's focus must stay positive.</li>
<li>Expect ups and cowns; some days are better than others</li>
<li>Be flexible in training to allow for the unexpected.</li>
<li>Set intermediate goals. (nb: try "smaller goals" that might lead to failure but provide a learning experience)</li>
<li>Concentrate on the task at hand.</li>
<li>Most mistakes in races are made early in the race.</li>
<li>Training should be rewarding</li>
</ul>

<p>Key quote: "It's not always fun, but it should always be rewarding." (13)</p>

<ul>
<li>Eat and sleep well.</li>
</ul>

<p>Key quote: "If you regularly eat and sleep well, one bad meal or poor night's sleep will ot have a negative effect on you." (13)</p>

<ul>
<li>Don't train when sick or injured.</li>
<li>Chronic health issues should be checked by a professional.</li>
<li>A good race or run is never a fluke.</li>
</ul>

<p>Key quote: "Sometimes a bad run is a fluke, but if you do run a great race, it is because you are capable of doing it." (14)</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>"Consistency in training is the single most important thing that leads to success." (14)</p>

<hr />

<p>I'm happy to say after reading through the first chapter, much of the training philosophy here is what has guided my own approach to coaching. That's not to say I haven't had my failures, but I think that's more because of a lack of a formula or guiding principle &amp; scientific research to undergird how I'm training athletes. I'm hoping the next chapters will help me build on that foundation of what I already know and am doing. And perhaps help correct me where I have been wrong.</p>
