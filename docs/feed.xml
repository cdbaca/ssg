            <content:encoded><![CDATA[ <p>Another year, another review. I'll be 100% honest, I both want and don't want to do this right now. Elaine just got back from the hospital yesterday after an extreme migraine that presented with stroke-like symptoms. I want to remember this year though, and don't want this to get lost in the static. Maybe another post will be forthcoming, but I don't know how much I want to relive a somewhat traumatic Christmas Day.</p>

<h1>Music</h1>

<p>2024 was Kendrick's year, no question.</p>

<h3>Favorite Songs</h3>

<p>Yet again, I don't feel like Spotify Wrapped captured the musical year for me. It may have even been worse than <a href="https://cbaca.blog/best-of-2023.html">last year</a>. But! Regardless of what they said I mostly listened to, I feel like we had a pretty great musical year. Here's another Spotify playlist of my favorites:</p>

<iframe style="border-radius:12px" src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/playlist/0NF9z5n8gXskwcb1w26HD7?utm_source=generator" width="100%" height="352" frameBorder="0" allowfullscreen="" allow="autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" loading="lazy"></iframe>

<h3>Favorite Albums (and a word about big "moments")</h3>

<p>The beginning of the year was filled with boygenius's <em>the record</em>, and Tyler Childers's <em>Live on Red Barn Radio I &amp; II</em>. </p>

<p>After that, I think it was primarily a hip-hop year, with some incredible releases:</p>

<ul>
<li><em>Ultra 85</em> - Logic</li>
<li><em>Chromakopia</em> - Tyler, the Creator</li>
<li><em>Bando Stone and the New World</em> - Childish Gambino</li>
<li><em>Samurai</em> - Lupe Fiasco</li>
</ul>

<p>and OF COURSE:</p>

<ul>
<li><em>GNX</em> - Kendrick Lamar</li>
</ul>

<p>The Kendrick and Drake beef was the highlight of the year. It's been talked about a bajillion times online and I do not need to repeat the story. But waking up every day or every other day for over a week to new diss tracks, and watching Kendrick just completely dominate from "eupohoria" forward was thrilling.</p>

<p>Three other albums worth mentioning:</p>

<ul>
<li><em>Weezer (blue)</em> - Weezer (there was a 30 year deluxe release and it was fun to rediscover the album)</li>
<li><em>No Name</em> - Jack White (this album just absolutely rips)</li>
<li><em>Beethoven Blues</em> - Jon Batiste</li>
</ul>

<h1>Movies</h1>

<p>The standout movies this year for me were:</p>

<ul>
<li><em>Dune, part II</em> - movie of the year for me. The sandworm scene, the end fight scene, and of course Paul's speech when he fully embraces his role as the Lisan al-Gaib (that scene gives me goosebumps every time I watch it)</li>
<li><em>Wicked</em> - I'm starting to realize just how much I like musicals</li>
<li><em>Midsommar</em> - Not released this year, but we watched it for the first time. Insane movie. Not a "favorite" but it really stuck in my head.</li>
<li><em>Deadpool and Wolverine</em> - just super fun</li>
<li><em>Wild Robot</em> - also fun, and quite touching</li>
<li><em>Wonka</em> - continuing the Timothée love</li>
<li><em>Poor Things</em> - So strange. Another "not a favorite" but it stuck in my head movie.</li>
<li><em>Interstellar</em> - IMAX re-release. It was amazing and overwhelming. Standout scene was the moment when Cooper had to re-align the two spaceships. It was <em>almost</em> too much to watch.</li>
</ul>

<h1>TV</h1>

<ul>
<li><em>The Penguin</em></li>
<li><em>No Good Deed</em></li>
<li><em>Nobody Wants This</em></li>
<li><em>Sopranos (season 1)</em> - I watched this when I had the flu in September, great TV.</li>
<li><em>The Joy of Painting with Bob Ross</em> - Silly, but we turn this on for Cooper every time we leave the house, and then we inadvertently watch it for one or two episodes at some point during the day.</li>
<li><em>Seinfeld</em></li>
<li><em>Six Feet Under</em> - we're still in the middle of watching season 1, but it's good
-<em>Love is Blind, seasons 6 and 7</em> - trash, but great trash?</li>
<li><em>3 Body Problem</em> - not as good as the book, of course, but fun anyway</li>
</ul>

<h1>Books</h1>

<ul>
<li><em>Shift</em> - Hugh Howey</li>
<li><em>Dust</em> - Hugh Howey</li>
<li><em>Four Thousand Weeks</em> - Oliver Burkeman</li>
<li><em>On the Edge of the Dark Sea of Darkness</em> - Andrew Peterson</li>
<li><em>Station Eleven</em> - Emily St. John Mandel</li>
<li><em>Cibola Burn</em> - James S.A. Corey</li>
<li><em>Nemesis Games</em> - James S.A. Corey</li>
<li><em>Babylon's Ashes</em> - James S.A. Corey</li>
<li><em>Moonbound</em> - Robin Sloan</li>
<li><em>Fellowship of the Ring</em> - J.R.R. Tolkien</li>
<li><em>When We Cease to Understand the World</em> - Benjamin Labatut</li>
<li><em>Demon Copperhead</em> - Barbara Kingsolver</li>
<li><em>Piranesi</em> - Susanna Clarke</li>
<li><em>The Silent Patient</em> - Alex Michaelides</li>
</ul>

<h1>Everything Else</h1>

<p>Notable events and things from the year:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>We started attending <a href="asd.church">All Saints Dallas</a> around July of this year, and this is the first time is a family in a few years that we have all <em>wanted</em> to be attending somewhere regularly.</p></li>
<li><p>This was my first year coaching cross country in a long time. There were so many cool moments, and it was great to be able to coach a team again. Despite some of its difficulties, coaching brings me joy in a way that many things do not.</p></li>
<li><p>I spent such a large portion of the year training for the Dinosaur Valley Endurance Run (25K). Lots and lots of weeks with lots and lots of miles. But I felt so strong and good overall. To make a long story short, I was going to run on the Saturday of the race, but nerves got the better of me, and I was up until about 2:30 AM. I was so lucky that the race organizers allowed shorter distances to run on either Saturday or Sunday without pre-notification, so I punted, moved to Sunday, and ran a great race (4th overall, 1st in my age group).</p></li>
<li><p>We took a little weekend trip to Kansas City in July to visit some good friends up there. It was filled with good food, lake relaxing, and just space to be friends. (Also, I'll probably always remember this was the weekend of the attempted assassination. Wild.)</p></li>
<li><p>We have a 13 year old 😵‍💫</p></li>
<li><p>I shot my first ducks this year! Hoping to become (albeit intermittently) something of a small game hunter in the coming years.</p></li>
</ul>

<hr />

<p>There was, of course, so much more. I'll address a couple of those things in the looking forward to 2025 post. But also, you just can't capture a year in words. These are the things that stand out now. As always, I'm grateful for another year with my beautiful family, another year of joy, sadness, grief, excitement, and all the things in between.</p>

            <title>A Quote On 'Seeing'</title>
            <pubDate>2024-12-12 11:41:29</pubDate>
            <link>https://cdbaca.github.io/ssg/a-quote-on-seeing.html</link>
            <guid>https://cdbaca.github.io/ssg/a-quote-on-seeing.html</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[ <p>A long quote incoming:</p>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p>And where do the symbols come from? From the years of childhood drawing during which every person develops a system of symbols. The symbol system becomes embedded in the memory, and the symbols are ready to be called out, just as you called them out to draw your childhood landscape.</p>
    
    <p>...</p>
    
    <p>To sum up, adult students beginning in art generally do not really see what is in front of their eyes -- That is, they do not perceive in the special way required for drawing. They take note of what's there, and quickly translate the perception into words and symbols mainly based on the symbol system developed throughout childhood and on what they know about the perceived object.</p>
    
    <p>What is the solution to this dilemma? Psychologist Robert Ornstein suggests that in order to draw, the artist must 'mirror' things or perceive them exactly as they are. Thus, you must set aside your usual verbal categorizing and turn your full visual attention to what you are perceiving -- to all of its details and how each detail fits into the whole configuration. In short, you must see the way an artist sees.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>--Betty Edwards, <em>The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain</em>, p. 82</p>

<p>Edwards is obviously talking about pragmatic "how" of drawing here, but I found this quote remarkably in line with philosophical inquiry regarding seeing the world "as it is" and how our pre-built categories affect what it is we perceive when we look at the world.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[ <h2>What have I been doing?</h2>

<p>Duck hunting was such a blast! It's been about a week now since I went, but man I had such a good time. We did an evening hunt that was really just more of a practice run for the morning (no ducks were killed, only shot at). But it was a good chance to get a feel for the rhythm of things, what to expect, and so on. In the morning, we arrived at the hunting location at about 5 AM, walked in with our layout blinds, got all set up and brushed in, and waited for shooting light. The stars were truly magnificent -- light pollution is pretty bad where I am so it was wonderful to see (and remember) what the stars really look like. I walked away with three birds from the hunt, and I was the first to kill one that day, so it was a special experience for sure. Now I'm trying to figure out how to get back out where I'm at. The closest location is Lake Bardwell, which is not difficult to get to.</p>

<p>Other than that, things have just seemed to be transitioning with the season, I think. My training cycle is nearly complete (the Dino Valley 25K is this Saturday), so I moved into my training taper period last week. I'm excited and nervous, but mostly excited I think!</p>

<p>The days blur together somewhat from the last two weeks -- there has just been a lot of that "everyday busy-ness" thing going on. Cassandra was here for about 5 days, which was great. </p>

<p>P's 11th birthday is TODAY! 11 years with that kiddo, and it has been a ride, let me tell you. I find myself thankful for her, though, more and more. We went rock climbing yesterday to celebrate and she did a lot of fear-conquering, which was really neat to see.</p>

<p>I'm currently reading Barbara Kingsolver's <em>Demon Copperhead</em>, which is sad and a bit tragic but with which I feel a strange familiarity. I did not grow up an orphan, but the setting of southern poverty gives it a sense of reality to me.</p>

<p>Personally, I'm trying and trying to stay away from general media, news, and feeds as much as possible. A habit this sticky is hard to break, though. Chrome is often deleted from my phone but I re-download it for practical reasons, and then that often leads to checking out Reddit or something else for a few minutes, so I haven't been fully disconnected. The goal is to continue to figure this out, however, because the moments when I'm not actively engaged with media and feeds are much calmer. My blog and the RSS reader are a much different story -- this continues to be a place where I want to be. It's the kind of web I want.</p>

<h2>What do I need to take care of?</h2>

<p>Unforunately, I think the Prius's power brakes are going out. A strange noise occurs when pushing down the brakes at a full stop, and the Prius forums indicate that this is a known issue on my Prius version. It usually results in a hefty repair bill, which will likely cost more than the car is worth. The long story short is, we need to take it into the dealer.</p>

<h2>What caught my interest?</h2>

<p>I don't want to say "nothing" here but... nothing I can think of, at least.</p>

            <title>On Losing an Election</title>
            <pubDate>2024-11-06 08:05:21</pubDate>
            <link>https://cdbaca.github.io/ssg/on-losing-an-election.html</link>
            <guid>https://cdbaca.github.io/ssg/on-losing-an-election.html</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[ <p>Talking with Elaine this morning after seeing the results, I had a (re-)realization that my daily life and my internet media consumption are in such strong contrast. I live in MAGA country (always have, basically, at least here in Texas). I'm surrounded by committed Republican voters who generally assume that everyone around them votes the same as they do.</p>

<p>But my internet consumption is clearly, <em>clearly</em> left of that. By a wide margin. Despite the fact that I live in MAGA-world, I really thought there was a good shot at a Democrat win across the board. (That is clearly <em>not</em> what happened.)</p>

<p>Two things are on my mind this morning in response to this. Of course I have some political opinions and have some generalized anxiety about how the next four year presidential term will play out. But even more than that:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>It's become increasingly clear (and stark after this morning) that my current media consumption habits are simply not serving me. Scrolling through Reddit feeds a few times a day, checking NYT and NPR, etc. are simply not giving me an accurate view of reality. They are also not helping my mental state... probably at all. I'm going to make it a goal over the coming weeks to devise a plan to change these habits for myself. I want to be a kind person, a good citizen, a loving husband and father, and a thoughtful, <em>well-informed</em> human being.</p></li>
<li><p>Richard Beck has been in my RSS feed for years. While I don't read everything he writes, there are occasions where he writes something that genuinely hits home and makes me feel sane. <a href="https://experimentaltheology.blogspot.com/2024/11/planting-gardens-in-babylon-on-how-to.html">This, from a sermon he wrote years ago</a>, titled "How to Lose an Election," is a gentle reminder that human history is peppered with situations where they lack political power (long quote incoming):</p></li>
</ol>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p>In my Bushnell talk, one of the points I made comes from Jeremiah 29. Some of the Israelites have returned home from their Babylonian exile. But many remain behind in Babylon. These write to the prophet Jeremiah asking if they should come home. But Jeremiah writes back to say, no, you should stay in Babylon. And not just stay, to multiply and thrive:</p>
    
    <p>Thus says the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel, to all the exiles whom I have sent into exile from Jerusalem to Babylon: Build houses and live in them; plant gardens and eat what they produce. Take wives and have sons and daughters; take wives for your sons, and give your daughters in marriage, that they may bear sons and daughters; multiply there, and do not decrease. But seek the welfare of the city where I have sent you into exile, and pray to the Lord on its behalf, for in its welfare you will find your welfare. </p>
    
    <p>Seek the welfare of the city, for it its welfare you will find your welfare. Crucially, the Israelites remain in Babylon as a marginalized, disenfranchised, exilic people. They do not control Babylon, nor will they ever control Babylon. Political power is not in their hands. And yet, there is work to do! Seek the welfare of the city.</p>
    
    <p>And let's be clear on this point, this is Babylon we are talking about. Babylon, the epitome of wickedness, oppression, injustice, violence, and evil in Biblical history and imagination. The point here is that the People of God thrive in places of political marginalization. The People of God thrive in Babylon. So there's no excuse for us not to thrive, even if we lost the election. No matter the outcome today, there is good, creative, generative, and beautiful work to do.</p>
    
    <p>How do you lose an election? It's simple.</p>
    
    <p>You plant gardens in Babylon.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>So how am I planting a garden? Well,  I'll probably literally plant a garden, but I'm raising my kiddos a certain way, I'm disengaging from the shit show that is national politics, and I'm looking to the community around me to build a life together.</p>

            <title>Weeknote 6 - 26 Oct to 1 Nov 2024</title>
            <pubDate>2024-11-01 15:50:34</pubDate>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[ <h2>What have I been doing?</h2>

<p>The big thing this week has been prepping for my first duck hunt (🦆)! I went last year with Zack right after Thanksgiving, but didn't have a license so I was just a bystander. We didn't bag anything last year either, so I'm hoping this is a good little trip for me. I'm SO excited, this is an experience out of my norm. I finished up my hunter's education, got my license, and set up my shotgun/accessories situation.</p>

<p>Halloween was also a fun time! I dressed as Miguel from Coco, and the girls were traditional skeletons from Dia de los Muertos. Lots of folks from the girls' school came over and we ate, passed out candy, and the girls were able to go trick or treating with their friends.</p>

<p>I'm getting reallllll close to the race (I think I'm right at 3 weeks out). My legs are a bit tired and I'm definitely feeling worn down some from training. But overall I think I am ready for the race -- my goal is still to place in the top 3 overall, but I'll be happy with a good race no matter what.</p>

<p>I took the step of deleting internet browser access from my phone, just to mitigate access to stupid feeds and news or whatever. It hasn't fully removed my proclivity for doomscrolling, but it's definitely better than it was, and my mood is anecdotally better as well.</p>

<h2>What do I need to take care of?</h2>

<p>Got the grass mowed last weekend, and that should be the last big mow for the season, thank goodness.</p>

<p>Just wanting to get through this next week mostly -- should be quick as I'm taking Thursday and Friday off, and we're hunting next Monday.</p>

<h2>What caught my interest?</h2>

<p>Just bingeing <a href="https://www.themeateater.com/shows/duck-camp-dinners">Duck Camp Dinners</a>, Jean-Paul Bourgeois is the man, and it's just hyping me up for hunting season.</p>
