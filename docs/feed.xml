            <content:encoded><![CDATA[ <h1>Chapter 10: Season-Tailored Training</h1>

<h2>Notes &amp; Quotes</h2>

<p>After the buildup of information and Daniels-specific training run types, it seems like chapter 10 is the meat of the entire formula. There are other chapters after this, and I may do one final post on the cross country chapter for my own  benefit. But this chapter gives the overall season-training philosophy Daniels suggests with the various training runs in phases for how and why to progress throughout a season.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>"The less fit you are, the less intense the training has to be to benefit." (151)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Training for athletes should be relatively tailored, both to the fitness of the athlete, and the time available for training.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>"First determine level of fitness based on current mileage and speeds of any workouts that make up training sessions, which allows runners to establish the proper VDOT value for all types of training." (152)</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>Phase Training</h3>

<p>Daniels suggests breaking seasonal training down into phases:</p>

<ul>
<li>Phase I for base training with a focus on foundation and injury prevention</li>
<li>Phase II for introducing initial quality runs</li>
<li>Phase III for transitional quality runs</li>
<li>Phase IV for peak performance/final quality runs</li>
</ul>

<p>In order of importance, the phases are I, IV, II, III, so depending on the amount of time available, the phases should be prioritized roughly in this order, with at least three weeks given to each phase (in order) before moving to the next phase. </p>

<p>[Example: if given 9 weeks for training, 3 weeks should be delegated to phase I, followed by phase II, then phase IV. You would increase/decrease and/or add phase III if given more or less time.]</p>

<p>Another note, if a runner only has three weeks, there's no point in "throwing them into the deep end." Start them like you would any other runner, giving them solid base/foundational training rather than risking injury.</p>

<p>On the flip side, if a runner is already running regularly, you may be able to skip phase I or even phase II depending on the level of fitness.</p>

<p>If you have time for all four phases, the focus or added training type should be as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Phase I</strong>: All E, with a single L run. Adding light strides 3x weekly if you have more than 3 weeks for phase I</li>
<li><strong>Phase II</strong>: 1L, 2E, with 2 added R days. The reason for this is you are only adding one new stressor during the phase (so just adding "running fast"). This is when you'd start to use VDOT to determine training speeds.</li>
<li><strong>Phase III:</strong> 1L, 2E, 1R, 1I for shorter distances. 2I and no R if runners are racing more than 3K. This adds some distance to the speed running, dipping to lactate threshold rather than pure anaerobic running.</li>
<li><strong>Phase IV</strong>: 1L, 1 session with both T &amp; R, 1 race, 2E. This adds the full aerobic pressure along with maintaining speed fitness.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>"Races are part of training." (156)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>^ so use them in place of an I run.</p>

<p>The first quality workout of the week should be considered the most important workout, regardless of the phase of training. If possible, it should be done on Monday or Tuesday (assuming the L run was on Sunday and race day is Saturday). We're shooting for 2-3 quality runs a week. (quality = T, I, and R sessions)</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>"The overall plan is designed to intoduce one new stress when moving from one phase of training to the next, and new phases will also provide for maintenance of benefits earned in each previous phase." (160)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Finally, he offers a chart that gives tables for determining speed v. endurance. Using this chart with a runner can help determine whether the runner is "better" at speed or endurance and where to focus during training. But, he also says:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>"Try working on the weakness first, but if that doesn't  bring positive results, concentrate on your strenght, and that may well improve both strength and weakness." (161)</p>
</blockquote>

            <title>Reading Daniels' Running Formula - Chapters 6 to 9</title>
            <pubDate>2025-06-02 16:12:17</pubDate>
            <link>https://cdbaca.github.io/ssg/reading-daniels-running-formula-chapters-6-to-9.html</link>
            <guid>https://cdbaca.github.io/ssg/reading-daniels-running-formula-chapters-6-to-9.html</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[ <h2>Notes &amp; Quotes</h2>

<p>The remainder of Part I of the book was relatively "common sense information" -- or information that I am personally not particularly interested in. These chapters covered environment/altitude specific training, treadmill training, "fitness training" (i.e., non-competitive training), and training breaks/supplemental training.</p>

<p>The altitude stuff I don't care much about at all. I will likely never be able to bring a team or runners up to Colarado to train (as much as I'd like to), and Daniels seems to indicate that it's not that big of a deal anyway. Moreso, the goal during training should be to mimic predicted race conditions.</p>

<p>I basically skipped the chapter on treadmill training. Again, not much I can do here with my own athletes, and if I'm stuck inside I'm not doing much on the treadmill because it sucks so much.</p>

<p>The fitness training chapter was decent, and will likely help me with some of my on-the-side coaching for brand new runners trying to get fit for local races or personal goals.</p>

<p>The training breaks/supplemental training chapter, again, was relatively common sense information. Although I do think his data on supplemental training for strength was lacking / out of date. I think it's relatively common knowledge in the running world now that strength training for runners should include heavy lifting. Body weight stuff, while it might help a little, will not provide the injury prevention/strength benefits needed to sustain a ton of mileage.</p>

<p>A big note from Daniels on resting is that athletes and coached ought to be very open to resting, both for planned and unplanned periods of time. Unplanned for things like illness/injury and planned for resisting burnout.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[ <p>I've been using the Arc browser for the better part of two years now. Mostly because I liked the interface and the ability to make "spaces." It's my personal daily driver for surfing the web. But it was off-putting when The Browser Company announced their "Arc Search" feature that would produce its own AI (haha) generated page to summarize the results. A "search engine that searched for you."</p>

<p>And now TBC announces they'll stop supporting/maintaining Arc to pivot to Dia, an AI-based browser.</p>

<p>Manu <a href="https://manuelmoreale.com/on-browsers-ai-and-the-web">sums it up well</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>"But more importantly, thereâ€™s something else about this whole idea of chatting-with-a-computer-to-get-answers-from-the-web that I find incredibly off-putting: the complete lack of potential for serendipity."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Maybe I'm just not reading the signs. Maybe the CEOs and big companies know better than I do what will work in the market. But whatever this AI-based web hellscape they want is, I'm really not interested in it. The web is for discovery. When all of the weirdness of the internet is wrapped up behind an LLM, it gets dumbed down to the most average, least interesting version of whatever it was in its original form.</p>

<p>Lame.</p>

            <title>Reading Daniels' Running Formula - Chapter 5</title>
            <pubDate>2025-05-28 15:49:10</pubDate>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[ <h1>Chapter 5: VDOT System of Training</h1>

<h2>Notes &amp; Quotes</h2>

<p>VDOT is Daniels' shorthand for the VO2max value, specifically the maximal value of oxygen being consumed over 1 minute. This is a performance-based score, so it's slightly different than the real VO2max value. For Daniels, this score can be used in training to determine appropriate paces for training in his various training run types (E, M, T, I, R).</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>"Using a person's race times gives a far better prediction of training intensities and other race performances that do tests in the lab. Race times reflect your max, your economy, your threshold, and your mental approach to racing, all in one measure -- the time it takes you to run a race." (76)</p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>As a personal aside, my own current VDOT would seem to be around the level of 48 or so according to his charts. While I think it's fairly accurate, I think it works best for runners who are already in training. My score indicates that my threshold pace should be around 7:02, which is not currently a pace I can hold in training for 20 minutes (I can for about 15 or 16 minutes right now... I imagine I'll be able to hold it soon as my training volume and intensity increases).</em></p>

<p>The majority of this chapter was filled with charts for the ranges of VDOTs, plus some additional charts for comparing VDOTs across age ranges (i.e., a VDOT of 48 at age 55 is much more competitive than a VDOT at say, 18).</p>

            <title>Reading Daniels' Running Formula - Chapter 4</title>
            <pubDate>2025-05-19 17:58:05</pubDate>
            <link>https://cdbaca.github.io/ssg/reading-daniels-running-formula-chapter-4.html</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[ <h1>Chapter 4: Types of Training and Intensities</h1>

<h2>Notes &amp; Quotes</h2>

<p>Daniels has five buckets of workouts that he uses to training distance athletes:</p>

<ul>
<li>Easy (E)</li>
<li>Marathon (M)</li>
<li>Threshold (T)</li>
<li>Interval (I)</li>
<li>Repetition (R)</li>
</ul>

<p>These workout types increase in intensity (going down the list), and they all serve a different training purpose.</p>

<h3>Easy</h3>

<ul>
<li>E runs are paced at 59-74% of a runner's VO2 max value. Individual runs should be somewhere between 30-150 minutes, and those single runs should be no more than 25-30% of the total weekly mileage for runners who run 40 miles a week or less. 30 minutes should be the minimum of an easy run.</li>
<li>"E running does a good job of strengthening the heart muscle because the maximum force of each stroke of the heart is reached when the heart rate is at about 60 percent of maximum." (50)</li>
<li>"Another benefit of E running is an incrase in vascularization (opening of more tiny blood vessels that feed the exercising muscles)." (51)</li>
</ul>

<h3>Marathon</h3>

<ul>
<li>This is training at your predicted marathon pace, typicall at 75-84% of VO2 max (or 80-89% of max HR). Invidual runs should be limited to the lesser of 110 minutes or 18 miles, whichever comes first. (55 - see chart in book for various runs.</li>
<li>"The physiological benefits are really not different from those gained during E running." (56)</li>
<li>Primary use seems to be for runners actually training for a half or full marathon to bring confidence in the ability to run at this pace for long distances, and also to train for taking in calories/water during that time.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Threshold</h3>

<ul>
<li>T runs should be "comfortably hard." Performed at 80-85% of VO2 max (or 80-86% for lesser trained runners). Roughly equal to 88-92% of max HR. A single session should not total more than 10% of total weekly mileage.</li>
<li>"The purpose of T runs [is to] improve your endurance -- teaching your body how to deal with a slightly more demanding pace for a prolonged period of time, or increasing the duration of time you can hold at a specific pace." (56)</li>
<li>Daniels recommends two different kinds of T runs: 1) tempo runs (longer sustained efforts, around 15-20 minutes) and 2) cruise intervals (a series of runs at T pace with short rests, giving a longer total time at desired threshold intensity).</li>
<li>A tempo run can also be done during what's called a "progression run" -- i.e., a run started at an E pace and then a gradual increase to T for the final miles.</li>
<li>Recommended work/rest (W/R) ratio for T runs is 5:1, so if doing cruise intervals, you could do 5 minutes cruise, 1 minute rest (doesn't have to be full rest, can be 1 minute E jog).</li>
</ul>

<h3>Interval</h3>

<ul>
<li>Intervals should be "hard." Performed at 95-100% of VO2 max. A max single session should be consist of the lesser of 10K or 8% of total weekly miles (so a 30 mile a week runner should run no more than 2.4 miles of intervals in a single session). Daniels also denotes another kind of run called "H" runs (Hard) for determining Intervals by time rather than distance.</li>
<li>"The most logical purpose of I training is to maximize aerobic power (VO2 max)" (60)</li>
<li>"It is good to normally use 3- to 5-minute work bouts durin gan I workout because you are guaranteed some time at max even when it takes a minute or two to reach max." (62)</li>
</ul>

<h3>Repetition</h3>

<ul>
<li>Repetitions should be performed at 105-120% of VO2 max, and should be the lesser of 5 miles or 5% of total weekly miles in a single training session.</li>
<li>"The primary purpose of R (repetition) training is to improve anaerobic power, speed, and economy of running." (66).</li>
<li>Due to the purpose of these runs, the W/R ratio should be 1:2-3, and the max time per repetition should be around 2 minutes.</li>
<li>"Most true R sessions will be made up of repeated 200s, 300s, 400s, 500s, and 600s for most runners." (67)</li>
<li>"It is always best to think in terms of time spentn running at various intensities, rather than distances covered, or else the slower runners on a team end up spending considerably more time doing the workouts than do the faster runners." (67)</li>
</ul>
