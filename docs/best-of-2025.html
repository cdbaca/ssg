    <h1 class="post-title">Best of 2025</h1>
    <p>I'm looking for ways of talking about this year without saying my immediate feelings about it. My inclination is to say the year was shitty. <em>Beyond shitty</em>. But that's a sort of surface layer feeling disguising something deeper. To be sure, there is a top layer of muck and grime that covered so much of how this year went. In <a href="https://cbaca.blog/best-of-2024.html">last year's post</a>, I gave some vague description about last Christmas Day. As we come up on this year's Christmas Day, it's not my first choice to relive those moments or the ones following.</p>

<p>But the truth is the things that happened last December have continued to have lasting impact on our family. Our daily life got turned upside-down, as we reckconed with the problem of Elaine's chronic migraines. They are debilitating, and while there have been moments, days, sometimes weeks of respite, the migraines always seem to be on the peripheral — an wanted house guest that has decided to make its way into our daily rhythms. </p>

<p>In many ways, life is "the same." I still work for Green Line, the girls still go to school, I still coach. Much of life now, however, is tinged with a melancholy that is hard to describe to people who do not have a similar experience. We are constantly trying to find new ways of fighting the migraines, constantly looking for the potential solution to the problem, and always wavering between a hope that things will get better and an acceptance that we are living in some kind of new normal.</p>

<p>The truth is also that our lives are strangely, severely cut through with new glimpses of the beauty surrounding us. In January and February, we were completely surrounded by the love and support of family and church community folks. I learned all year long that I have far more energy to give to my family than I ever thought possible before. We have all come to a deeper appreciation of our faith; I'm even praying and reading scripture regularly again, and often find myself wondering if pastoral work may be in my (distant, distant future). </p>

<p>It's true what they say. It is often the experiences in life you would never choose, the ones you avoid at all costs, that help tranform you into the person you ought to be. I can tell you that I will never, ever look at 2025 with any kind of simple fondness. But I may look at it as the year that changed me, that changed our family, that helped us to become strong and courageous and to learn to have faith again.</p>

<h1>Music</h1>

<h3>Favorite Songs</h3>

<p>As always, I've tried to keep track of my favorite songs of the year. The ones I returned to over and over again:</p>

<iframe data-testid="embed-iframe" style="border-radius:12px" src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/playlist/4LkfpQGCoG0Twh7tzGhiSc?utm_source=generator" width="100%" height="352" frameBorder="0" allowfullscreen="" allow="autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" loading="lazy"></iframe>

<p>Spotify Wrapped didn't capture much of this because I used Apple Music as a test from August to October.</p>

<h3>Favorite Albums</h3>

<p>Not as big of a hip-hop year for me, especially in terms of new releases. Many of these albums are older, because I was heavily influenced by the <em>Last Song Standing</em> series this year on the best albums of the 21st century. My biggest, favorite albums this year:</p>

<p>-<em>Ego Death at a Bachelorette Party</em> - Hayley Williams
-<em>Discovery</em> - Daft Punk
-<em>Snipe Hunter</em> - Tyler Childers
-<em>The Blueprint</em> - Jay-Z
-<em>Welcome to my Blue Sky</em> - Momma</p>

<h1>Movies</h1>

<p>Lots of new movies were "meh" this year. Mid as the kids say.</p>

<p>-<em>Inception</em> - rewatch with Lyla, with her watching for the first time. Her mind was blown.
-<em>K Pop Demon Hunters</em> - okay, so it was actually good
-Marvel: <em>Thunderbolts</em>, <em>Fantastic 4</em>, <em>Captain America: BNW</em> (Thunderbolts was not bad, FF was just "okay", Captain America was pretty weak)
-<em>Together</em> (strange)
-<em>Meet the Roses</em> - provided some laughs, probably forgettable
-<em>Superman</em> (7.5/10)
-<em>Materialists</em> - one note the entire movie, boring
<em>Mickey 17</em> (weird, but okay sci-fi)
<em>The Woman in Cabin 10</em> - meh
<em>Companion</em> - solid, Black Mirror-esque
<em>The Assessment</em> - great concept, pretty bleak
<em>A House of Dynamite</em> - not <em>exactly</em> realistic but a great thriller
<em>Wicked: For Good</em> - okay, not even close to the first movie
<em>Sinners</em> - a surprising vampire movie, enjoyable
<em>Die My Love</em>
<em>My Neighbor Totoro</em>
<em>Kiki's Delivery Service</em> - these two Studio Ghiblis were maybe my favorite watches of the year
<em>Zootopia 2</em> - standard Pixar fare</p>

<h1>TV</h1>

<p>-<em>The Pitt</em> - show of the year, and it came out in January
-<em>Andor</em> - maybe I take back show of the year for the above, this was also incredible
-<em>Your Friends &amp; Neighbors</em> - never disappointed with Jon Hamm
-<em>Love is Blind</em> (season whatever) - as always, trashy and great
-<em>The $1 House</em> - Tia Weston's YouTube channel, which we now look forward to every Sunday
-<em>The Diplomat</em>
-<em>The Bear</em> season 4
-<em>Nobody Wants This</em> season 2
-<em>Pop Culture Jeopardy!</em>
-<em>US Open</em>
-<em>The Four Seasons</em>
-<em>Black Mirror</em> season 7
-<em>Daredevil</em> (season 3 and Born Again), season 3 was definitely a top tier season of television</p>

<h1>Books</h1>

<p>-<em>Oryx and Crake</em> - Margaret Atwood
-<em>Dune</em> (reread) - Frank Herbert
-<em>Dark Matter</em> - Blake Crouch
-<em>The Great Gatsby</em> - F. Scott Fitzgerald
-<em>Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norrell</em> (reread) - Susanna Clarke
-<em>Prey</em> - Michael Crichton
-<em>Daniels Running Formula</em> - Jack Daniels
-<em>The Dream Hotel</em> - Laila Lalami
-<em>Annihilation</em> (reread) - Jeff VenderMeer
-<em>Never Let Me Go</em> - Kazuo Ishiguro
-<em>Children of Time</em> - Adrian Tchaikovsky
-<em>The Poisonwood Bible</em> - Barbara Kingsolver
-<em>The Deep Places</em> - Ross Douthat
-<em>Your Money or Your Life</em> - Vicki Robin, Joe Dominguez
-<em>Persepolis Rising</em> - James S. A. Corey
-<em>Tiamat's Wrath</em> (finishing now) - James S. A. Corey
-<em>Dilla Time</em> - Dan Charnas</p>

<h1>Everything Else</h1>

<p>-One major milestone was my goal over the summer of training for a 5:30 1600m. I trained myself all summer using the Daniels' Running Formula method, and boy did it work. I started the summer at 6:00 flat, and by Labor Day was able to run a 5:36. I have not been that fast since high school, so that was a fun experiment.
-Speaking of running, the cross country season was excellent this year. I also used much of the running formula to help train the team, and nearly all students PRed at the state meet, along with all running PRs at some point during the season.
-I know a lot about migraines. And treatments for migraines.
-I became the athletic director for the girls' school. TBD if that was a good idea or a terrible one.
-A couple hunting trips throughout the year, and although I'm sure I've gotten my own birds before, a recent trip resulted in me nailing a teal with 100% certainty! (no one else was shooting at the time). Felt like a big moment.
-Favorite podcasts this year were The Bible Project, Ross Douthat's Interesting Times, some Ezra Klein Show, the returned Heavyweight, and Last Song Standing/Dissect</p>
