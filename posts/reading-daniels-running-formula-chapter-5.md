# Chapter 5: VDOT System of Training

## Notes & Quotes

VDOT is Daniels' shorthand for the VO2max value, specifically the maximal value of oxygen being consumed over 1 minute. This is a performance-based score, so it's slightly different than the real VO2max value. For Daniels, this score can be used in training to determine appropriate paces for training in his various training run types (E, M, T, I, R).

>"Using a person's race times gives a far better prediction of training intensities and other race performances that do tests in the lab. Race times reflect your max, your economy, your threshold, and your mental approach to racing, all in one measure -- the time it takes you to run a race." (76)


*As a personal aside, my own current VDOT would seem to be around the level of 48 or so according to his charts. While I think it's fairly accurate, I think it works best for runners who are already in training. My score indicates that my threshold pace should be around 7:02, which is not currently a pace I can hold in training for 20 minutes (I can for about 15 or 16 minutes right now... I imagine I'll be able to hold it soon as my training volume and intensity increases).*

The majority of this chapter was filled with charts for the ranges of VDOTs, plus some additional charts for comparing VDOTs across age ranges (i.e., a VDOT of 48 at age 55 is much more competitive than a VDOT at say, 18).
