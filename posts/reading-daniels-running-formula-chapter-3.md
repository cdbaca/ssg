# Chapter 3: Physiological and Personal Training Profiles

## Notes

The big takeaway from this chapter seems to be that there are a variety of baseline metrics that can be used to measure performance potential:

- VO2 Max (maximum oxygen consumption rate) 
- vVO2 Max (speed at which the athlete runs when at VO2 Max)
- Running economy (the curve on which we determine a runner's oxygen consumption at various intensity levels)
- BLa (Blood lactate levels at various intensity levels)
- Heart rate (max HR, resting HR, blood hemoglobin levels)

## Quotes

> "It is without question that vVO2 max is a better way to compare potential running performance than is either economoy or VO2 independently." (38)

> "The important thing for any runner is to improve as many variables as possible in order to perform better... it is necessary to include training that will ipmrove aerobic power (VO2 max) and running economy, and as either, or both, of these variables ipmroves, there will be an improvement in the important vVO2 max variable." (42)

> "If the purpose of a specific workout is to spend time at a specific *speed* of running, then it might be necessary to not let heart rate be the guide. but if *intensity* of effort is the most important thing being sought, then heart rate can be very useful."
